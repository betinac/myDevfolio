## Portfolio Configuration with Google Sheets for Contact Form (optional)

This guide explains how to set up Google Sheets to use it with the contact form in your portfolio and configure the necessary environment variables in Vercel.

### Setting Up Google Sheets for Your Portfolio

1. **Configure Google Sheets API**:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (or select an existing one).
   - Enable the **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API** for this project.
   - In "Credentials," create a **Service Account** and download the credentials JSON file.

2. **Share Your Google Sheet**:
   - Open your Google Sheet and share access with the service account email (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`) that you created in Step 1. Ensure that it has **Editor** permissions.
   - Copy your spreadsheet ID from the URL (the part between `/d/` and `/edit`), which will be used for `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`.

3. **Setting Up Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   To enable Google Sheets functionality on Vercel, you need to configure the following environment variables.

   #### Steps to Add Environment Variables in Vercel

   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Click on **Add New Variable** and add each variable with its corresponding value as follows:

     - **Variable Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SHEETS_ENABLED`
       - **Value**: `true`
       - **Environment**: Select the appropriate environment (e.g., Production, Preview, Development).

     - **Variable Name**: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
       - **Value**: The service account email from Step 1.
       - **Environment**: Choose the environment as needed.

     - **Variable Name**: `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
       - **Value**: Copy the private key from your service account JSON file. Make sure to paste it exactly as it appears, without adding `\n` for line breaks if entering directly in Vercel.
       - **Environment**: Select the desired environment.

     - **Variable Name**: `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
       - **Value**: The ID of your Google Sheet.
       - **Environment**: Select the appropriate environment.

     - **Variable Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL`
       - **Value**: The URL of the Google Apps Script, if used (optional).
       - **Environment**: Select the desired environment.

   - Once all variables are entered, redeploy your project to apply the changes.

### Example Environment Variable Configuration in `.env.local` (for local development)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SHEETS_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBg...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/EXAMPLE_SCRIPT_ID/exec
